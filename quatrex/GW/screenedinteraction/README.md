- get_number_connected_blocks.m use this instead of just saying that we have 3x block size after matrix multiplication.
The above function finds out if elements of a sparse matrix are so far off diagonal that the block size after
matrix multiplication has to be extended to 3x (or 2x).
- find out how the correction work for matrix multiplication
